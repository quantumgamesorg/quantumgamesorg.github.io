		<h2>600 Cell</h2>

		<p>The 600-cell is the generalization of the regular icosahedron in a space of four dimensions. It has many simple geometrical patterns in it that provide proofs of an important result in the foundations of quantum mechanics due to Bell, Kochen and Specker that rules out the existence of a class of deterministic theories proposed as alternatives to quantum mechanics. The patterns can be displayed as tables of numbers possessing a characteristic signature that guarantees that they provide proofs of the result.</p>
		
		<p>It is necessary to be familiar with a few facts about the 600-cell to understand how the number patterns originate in them. The 600-cell has 120 vertices that lie on the surface of a sphere in four-dimensional space. The vertices come in antipodal pairs and each pair is represented by a number from 1 to 60 in the adjoining table. The vertex pairs have been grouped together in sets of four, with the members of any set being in mutually orthogonal directions from the center of the sphere; there are 75 such sets, and each will be termed a “basis”.</p>
		
		<p>The bases have been grouped together in blocks of three, with there being five blocks in every row, and every column, of the table. Each vertex pair occurs exactly once in every horizontal row, and vertical column, of blocks. Thus, each vertex pair occurs five times throughout the table.</p>
		
		<p>The patterns in the table that provide proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker (BKS) theorem consist of all subsets of its bases that satisfy the following two conditions: (1) the number of bases is odd, and (2) each of the numbers that occurs in the bases occurs in an even number of them.  The patterns are thus just like the winning patterns in Peres-1 and Peres-2.</p>
		
		<p>The 600-cell has well over a billion patterns in it that prove the BKS theorem. The pull-down menu allows you to see some of them. If you click on 30-15, for example, you will see 30 vertex pairs, each occurring twice, over the 15 bases of the pattern, which are highlighted in green for easy viewing (30 x 2 = 15 x 4). Similarly, if you click on 48-25, you will see 46 vertex pairs, each occurring twice, and two vertex pairs, each occurring four times, over 25 bases (46 x 2 + 2 x 4 = 25 x 4).</p>
		
		<p>You can check the validity of any pattern by verifying that it has an odd number of bases in it and then hovering your cursor over any number in it to see that it occurs an even number of times over the pattern. Alternatively, the moves box and scoreboard should allow you to verify these features more easily.</p>
		
		<p>Instead of calling up a pattern, you could try making up one yourself. Keep clicking on bases, using the moves box and scoreboard to keep track of your progress as you go along. You can undo earlier moves by clicking on any lighted bases. You win only when both the moves box and scoreboard are lit up entirely in green, and the title at the top then changes to “God does play dice!” However, be warned that winning by trial and error is not easy!</p>
