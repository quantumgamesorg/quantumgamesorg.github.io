		<h2>600 Cell</h2>

		<p>The 600-cell is the generalization of the regular icosahedron in a space of four dimensions. It has billions of simple patterns in it that provide proofs of an important theorem in the foundations of quantum mechanics due to Bell, Kochen and Specker.  The theorem rules out the existence of a class of deterministic theories that were proposed as alternatives to quantum mechanics. The patterns can all be seen as subsets of numbers in the adjoining table with a characteristic signature that makes them easy to recognize. </p>  
		
	        <p>It is necessary to be familiar with a few facts about the 600-cell to understand how the patterns arise in it. The 600-cell has 120 vertices that lie on the surface of a four-dimensional sphere. The vertices come in antipodal pairs, each of which is represented by a number from 1 to 60 in the adjoining table. The four numbers grouped together represent a set of vertex pairs that are in mutually orthogonal directions from the center of the sphere. There are 75 such groups, and each will be termed a basis.</p>

		<p>The bases are grouped together in blocks of three, with five blocks in every row and every column of the table. Each vertex pair occurs once in every horizontal row of blocks, and also once in every vertical column. Thus, each vertex pair occurs five times over the entire table.</p>

		<p>The patterns in the table that provide proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem consist of all odd numbers of bases with the property that each of the vertex pairs (or numbers) that occurs in them occurs in an even number of them. The patterns are thus just like the winning patterns in Peres-1 and Peres-2. </p>

		<p>The 600-cell has well over a billion such patterns in it, and you can call up a few of them using the pull-down menu. If you click on 30-15, for example, you will see 30 vertex pairs, each occurring twice, over the 15 bases of the pattern (30 x 2 = 15 x 4). Similarly, if you click on 48-25, you will see 46 vertex pairs, each occurring twice, and two vertex pairs, each occurring four times, over 25 bases (46 x 2 + 2 x 4 = 25 x 4). The patterns are highlighted in green for easy viewing.</p>

		<p>You can check the validity of any pattern by seeing that it consists of an odd number of bases and then hovering your cursor over any number in it to see that it occurs an even number of times over the pattern. You can also use check these features using the basis counter and the scoreboard. </p>

		<p> To call up an arbitrary pattern, enter a 0 or 1 in each of the 33 blocks at the bottom and click the Set button to the right. The pattern will be displayed along with the counts of vertex pairs (or numbers) and bases in it. </p>

		<p> You could also try making up a pattern of your own. Keep clicking on bases until the basis counter, table and scoreboard are all lit up only in green. You can undo any earlier moves by clicking on lighted bases. However, making up a pattern by trial and error is not easy!</p>
