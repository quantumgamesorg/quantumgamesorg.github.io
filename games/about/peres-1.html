		<h2> Origin of the game</h2>

		<p>Peres-1 is a numbers game that originated in the work of the Israeli physicist Asher Peres on the foundations of quantum mechanics. It is called Peres-1 to distinguish it from Peres-2, also featured on this site. However, you don’t need to know anything about quantum mechanics to play either of these games. But if you’re curious to learn how they arose, read on…</p>

		<p>In 1935 Einstein and his colleagues Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen wrote a paper in which they expressed their dissatisfaction with quantum mechanics. It’s not that they thought it was wrong, it’s just that they felt it was an incomplete theory because it denied the existence of an objective physical reality and often talked in terms of probabilities instead of making definite predictions about the properties of physical systems. They believed it would eventually be superseded by a better theory that conformed more closely to their notions of what nature was really like. Einstein’s unhappiness with the quantum theory passed into the popular folklore as the saying “God doesn’t play dice”.</p>

		<p>In the mid-1960s the physicist John Bell and, independently, the mathematicians Simon Kochen and Ernst Specker established an important result that was then extended by Bell to show that the hopes of Einstein and his colleagues could never be met. Bell did this by showing that theories of the sort favored by Einstein and his colleagues predicted outcomes for certain experiments that differed from those of quantum mechanics. A series of increasingly precise experiments carried out over the next five decades (and recognized by the award of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics to John Clauser, Alain Aspect and Anton Zeilinger) showed that quantum mechanics was right and the alternative theories were wrong. The consensus among physicists now is that the weird and counterintuitive features of quantum mechanics that Einstein objected to are not artifacts of the theory but actual features of the world we live in.</p>

		<p>The result of Bell, Kochen and Specker, which was the crucial first step in this process, was established (in different ways by Bell and by Kochen and Specker) by arguments that are not terribly easy to follow. Peres showed (a little over two decades later) how to arrive at their conclusion by a much simpler argument. If you play the game Peres-1 and win, you would have succeeded in reconstructing Peres’ proof of the so-called Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem that enshrines their principal conclusion.</p>
