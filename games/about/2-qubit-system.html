		<h2>The two-qubit system</h2>

	        <p>Like the 600-cell, the two-qubit system has many number patterns in it that provide proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem. You might want to look at the exhibit for the 600-cell first, as it has many features in common with this one but is easier to follow.</p> 
		
		<p>The numbers 1 to 60 in the adjoining table represent special states of a two-qubit system (a qubit, or quantum bit, is the basic unit of information storage in a quantum computer). The four numbers grouped together represent a "basis", or a set of mutually orthogonal states.  There are 105 bases in the table, and each state occurs in seven of them. The bases are grouped together in blocks of three, with five blocks in each of the seven horizontal rows of blocks that make up the table. Each state occurs once in the first row of blocks and six times elsewhere in the table. </p>

		<p>The patterns in the table that provide proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem consist of all odd numbers of bases with the property that each of the numbers that occurs in them occurs in an even number of them.   </p>

		<p>The table has over a billion such patterns in it, and you can see some of them by using the pull-down menu. If you click on 26-13, for example, you will see 26 states, each occurring twice, over the 13 bases of the pattern (26 x 2 = 13 x 4). Similarly, if you click on 37-23, you will see 37 states, 29 of which occur twice, 7 four times and one six times over the 23 bases of the pattern (29 x 2 + 7 x 4 + 1 x 6 = 23 x 4). The patterns are highlighted in green for easy viewing.</p>

		<p>You can check the validity of any pattern by hovering your cursor over the numbers in it, or by using the basis counter and scoreboard.		
	   
	         <p>Instead of calling up a pattern, you could try making up one on your own. Keep clicking on bases until the basis counter, table and scoreboard are all lit up only in green. You can undo any earlier moves simply by clicking on lighted bases. However, making up a pattern by trial and error is not easy!</p>
		
		<p> You can also call up an arbitrary pattern by entering a 0 or 1 in each of the 64 small boxes to the left of the table and clicking the Set button below them. This will make the pattern appear in the table and the counts of the vertex pairs and bases in it will be shown under Formula.  </p>
