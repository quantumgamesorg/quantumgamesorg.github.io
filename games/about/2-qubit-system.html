		<h2>The two-qubit system</h2>

	        <p>Like the 600-cell, the two-qubit system has many number patterns in it that provide proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem. You might want to look at the exhibit for the 600-cell first, as it has many features in common with this one and is easier to follow.</p> 
		
		<p>The numbers 1 to 60 in the adjoining table represent special states of a system of two qubits (a qubit, or quantum bit, is the basic unit of information storage in a quantum computer). The four numbers grouped together represent a set of mutually orthogonal states, or a “basis”.  There are 105 bases in the table, and each state occurs in seven of them. The bases are grouped together in blocks of three, with five blocks in every row of the table. Each state occurs once in the first row of blocks and six times elsewhere in the table. </p>

		<p>The patterns in the table that provide proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem consist of all odd numbers of bases with the property that each of the numbers that occurs in them occurs in an even number of them.   </p>

		<p>The table has over a billion such patterns in it, and you can see some of them by using the pull-down menu. If you click on 26-13, for example, you will see 26 states, each occurring twice, over the 13 bases of the pattern (26 x 2 = 13 x 4). Similarly, if you click on 37-23, you will see 37 states, 29 of which occur twice, 7 four times and one six times over 23 bases (29 x 2 + 7 x 4 + 1 x 6 = 23 x 4). The patterns are highlighted in green to make them stand out from the background.</p>

		<p>You can check the validity of any pattern in the same way as for the 600-cell, by looking at the basis counter and the scoreboard or by hovering your cursor over any of the numbers in it.		
	   
	         <p>Instead of calling up a pattern, you could try making up one on your own by clicking repeatedly on bases, using the basis counter and scoreboard as guides as you go along. However, hitting upon a pattern by trial and error is not easy.</p>
