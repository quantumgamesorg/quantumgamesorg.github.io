		<h2>The two-qubit system</h2>

		<p>Like the exhibit for the 600-cell, this exhibit features many number patterns that provide proofs of the BKS theorem. The visitor might want to view that exhibit first since this one has many features in common with it but is a little more complicated.</p>
		
		<p>The numbers 1 to 60 in the adjoining table represent special states of a system of two qubits (a qubit, or a quantum bit, is the basic unit of information storage in a quantum computer). The four numbers grouped together represent a set of mutually orthogonal states, or a “basis”.  There are 105 bases in all, and each state occurs in seven of them. The bases have been collected together in blocks of three. Each state occurs once in the first row of blocks and six times elsewhere in the table.</p>
		
		<p>The patterns in the table that provide proofs of the BKS theorem consist of all subsets of its bases that satisfy the following two conditions: (1) the number of bases is odd, and (2) each of the numbers that occurs in the bases occurs in an even number of them.</p>
		
		<p>The two-qubit system has billions of patterns in it that prove the BKS theorem. You can see some of them using the pull-down menu. If you click on 26-13, for example, you will see 26 states, each occurring twice, over the 13 bases of the pattern, which are highlighted in green for easy viewing (26 x 2 = 13 x 4). Similarly, if you click on 37-23, you will see 37 states, 29 of which occur twice, 7 of which occur four times and one of which occurs six times, over 23 bases (29 x 2 + 7 x 4 + 1 x 6 = 23 x 4).</p>
		
		<p>You can check the validity of any pattern by verifying that it has an odd number of bases in it and then hovering your cursor over any number in it to see that the number occurs an even number of times over the pattern. Alternatively, the moves box and scoreboard should allow you to verify these features more easily.</p>
		
		<p>Instead of calling up a pattern, you could try making up one on your own by clicking on the bases you want, using the moves box and the scoreboard to guide you as go along. You win only when both the moves box and scoreboard are lit up entirely in green, and the title at the top then changes to “God does play dice!” However, be warned that winning by trial and error is not easy!</p>
