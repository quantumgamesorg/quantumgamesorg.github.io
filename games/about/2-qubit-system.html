		<h2>The two-qubit system</h2>

	        <p>Like the 600-cell, the two-qubit system has many number patterns in it that provide proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem. You might want to look at the exhibit for the 600-cell first before looking at this one, as the two have many features in common and this exhibit is also a bit more complicated.</p> 
		
		<p>The numbers 1 to 60 in the adjoining table represent special states of a two-qubit system (a qubit, or quantum bit, being the basic unit of information storage in a quantum computer). The four numbers grouped together represent a set of mutually orthogonal states, or a “basis”.  There are 105 bases in all, and each state occurs in seven of them. The bases are grouped together in blocks of three, there being five rows of blocks in the table. Each state occurs once in the first row of blocks and six times elsewhere in the table. </p>

		<p>The patterns in the table that provide proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem consist of all odd numbers of its bases with the property that each of the numbers that occurs in them occurs in an even number of them.   </p>

		<p>The table has over a billion patterns in it that prove the theorem, and you can see some of them by using the pull-down menu. If you click on 26-13, for example, you will see 26 states, each occurring twice, over the 13 bases of the pattern (26 x 2 = 13 x 4). Similarly, if you click on 37-23, you will see 37 states, 29 of which occur twice, 7 four times and one six times over 23 bases (29 x 2 + 7 x 4 + 1 x 6 = 23 x 4). The patterns are highlighted in green to make them stand out from the background.</p>

		<p>You can check the validity of any pattern by verifying that it has an odd number of bases and then hovering your cursor over any number in it to see that it occurs an even number of times over the pattern. Alternatively, the basis counter and scoreboard should also allow you to check these features.</p>

		<p>Instead of calling up a pattern, you could try making up one on your own by clicking on bases, using the basis counter and the scoreboard as guides as you go along. You win only when both the basis counter and scoreboard are lit up entirely in green, and the title at the top then changes to “God does play dice!” However, be warned that winning by trial and error is not easy!</p>
