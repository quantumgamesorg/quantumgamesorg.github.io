		<h2>GHZ-Mermin Pentagram</h2>

		<p>The source S periodically sends out signals to Alice’s and Bob’s detectors that reach them at the same time.</p>

		<p>Alice and Bob each choose one of the lines of circles on their detector to light up in response to the signals from the source. They do this randomly and independently in each run just before the signals arrive.</p>

		<p>The number of panels that light up red in the chosen line of either Alice’s or Bob’s detector is always odd.</p>

		<p>The one (or more) common panel(s) that light(s) up on both detectors always has/have the same color(s) on both.</p>

		<p>The pattern of lights observed in this demonstration illustrates the phenomenon of quantum entanglement (or “spooky action at a distance”), which is a correlation between events at distant locations that cannot be traced back to a common cause in the past.</p>

		<p>Click on “Explanation” in the Menu to learn how this demonstration reveals the presence of entanglement.</p>

		<p>This demonstration is closely linked to the game Peres-2, although the connection is not obvious.</p>
