		<h2>Peres-Mermin Square</h2>

		<p>The source S periodically sends out signals to Alice’s and Bob’s detectors that reach them at the same time.</p>

		<p>Alice chooses one of the rows R1, R2 or R3 of her detector to light up in response to the signals, and Bob one of the columns C1, C2 or C3 of his. They do this randomly and independently in each run just before the signals arrive.</p>

		<p>The number of panels that light up red in the chosen row of Alice’s detector is always even.</p>

		<p>The number of panels that light up red in the chosen column of Bob’s detector is always odd.</p>

		<p>The one common panel that lights up on both detectors always has the same color on both.</p>

		<p>The pattern of lights observed in this demonstration illustrates the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, which is a correlation between events at distant locations that cannot be traced back to a common cause in the past.</p>

		<p>Click on “Explanation” in the Menu to learn how this demonstration reveals the presence of entanglement.</p>

		<p>This demonstration is closely linked to the game Peres-1, although the connection is not obvious.</p>
