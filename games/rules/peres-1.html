		<h2>Rules</h2>

		<p>The gameboard consists of 24 circles containing the numbers 1 to 24, with each circle containing four numbers and each number occurring in four circles.</p>

		<p>The six inner circles contain the numbers in their natural order, while the outer circles in line with a pair of inner circles contain complementary mixes of the numbers in them.</p>

		<p>The object of the game is to pick an odd number of circles in such a way that each of the numbers that occurs in them occurs in an even number of them. There are many ways of winning the game, but they all involve picking nine or more circles. Click on “Display a solution” in the Menu to see a random example of a winning pattern.</p>

		<p>To play the game, place your cursor on a circle and click, causing it to light up in red. Keep clicking on other circles until you either win or are forced to quit. The moves box shows the number of circles you have clicked, with odd numbers shown on a green background and even ones on a red one. The scoreboard shows the number of times each number in it occurs in the circles you have picked, with even occurrences (including zero) shown in green and odd occurrences in red. You win the game only when the gameboard, moves box and scoreboard are all lit up only in green and the title at the top then changes from "Does God play dice?" to “Yes, God does play dice!”</p>

		<p>You can undo earlier moves by clicking on lighted circles. If you place your cursor on any circle, the numbers in it are shown in bold font on the scoreboard, allowing you to see how often they occur in the lighted circles. This could help you in planning your future moves.</p>
