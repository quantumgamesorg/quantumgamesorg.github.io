		<h2>Rules</h2>

		<p>The gameboard consists of 24 circles containing the numbers 1 to 24, with each circle containing four numbers and each number occurring in four circles.</p>

		<p>The six inner circles contain the numbers in their natural order, while the outer circles in line with a pair of inner circles contain complementary mixes of the numbers in them.</p>

		<p>The object of the game is to pick an odd number of circles in such a way that each of the numbers that occurs in them occurs in an even number of them. There are many ways of winning the game, but they all involve picking nine or more circles. Click on “Display a solution” in the Menu to see a random example of a winning pattern.</p>

		<p>To play the game, place your cursor on a circle and click, causing it to light up red. Then keep clicking on other circles until you either win the game or have to quit. The moves box shows the number of circles you have clicked, with odd numbers shown in green and even ones in red. The scoreboard shows the number of times each of the numbers in it occurs in the circles you have clicked, with even occurrences shown in green and odd ones in red. You win the game only when both the moves box and the scoreboard are lit up entirely in green, and the title at the top then changes from “Does God play dice?” to “Yes, God does play dice!”</p>

		<p>You can undo any earlier moves by clicking on the lighted circles. Also, if you place your cursor on a circle, the scoreboard shows how often each of the numbers in it occurs over all the lighted circles; that could help you plan your future moves better!</p>

		<p>Click on “Explanation” in the Menu for a non-technical explanation of why winning the game proves Einstein wrong.</p>
