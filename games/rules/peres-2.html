		<h2>Peres-2</h2>

		<p>This game is very similar to Peres-1, except that the gameboard now has 25 circles containing the numbers 1 through 40, with each circle having eight numbers and each number occurring in five different circles. The object of the game is the same as in Peres-1, namely, to pick an odd number of circles in such a way that each of the numbers that occurs in them occurs in an even number of them. Click on “Display a solution” in the Menu to see a random example of a winning pattern (of which there are many).</p>

		<p>You can play this game just like Peres-1, by clicking on circles until you either win or are forced to quit. The moves box and scoreboard help you keep track of your progress and the title at the top changes to “God does play dice!” when you win the game.</p>

		<p>The explanation for why winning Peres-2 proves Einstein wrong is similar to that given for Peres-1.</p>
