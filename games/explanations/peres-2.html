		<h2>Peres-2</h2>

		<p>This game is very similar to Peres-1, except that the gameboard now has 25 circles containing the numbers 1 to 40, with each circle having eight numbers in it and each number occurring in five different circles. The object of the game is the same as in Peres-1, namely, to pick an odd number of circles in such a way that each of the numbers occuring in them occurs in an even number of them. Click on “Display a solution” in the sidebar to see a random example of a winning pattern (of which there are many).</p>

		<p>You can play this game just like Peres-1; keep clicking on circles until you win or are forced to quit. The moves box and scoreboard help you keep track of your progress, and you win only if both of them are lit up only in green. The title at the top changes to “God does play dice!” when you win the game. </p>
