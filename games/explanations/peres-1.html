		<h2>Why winning Peres-1 proves Einstein wrong</h2>

		<p>The numbers 1 to 24 in the game each represent a yes-no question that can be asked of a quantum system (of which an atom or a molecule might be an example). Each question amounts to asking the system if it possesses a certain property or not, and the system replies with either a “yes” or a “no”.  The four questions in any circle represent a compatible set of questions, i.e., ones that can all be asked of the system using the same experimental arrangement. By contrast, any four questions that do not occur together in one of the circles constitute an incompatible set in that there is no experimental arrangement that allows them all to be posed to the system at the same time.</p>

		<p>How does the system respond to a compatible set of questions? There is one inflexible rule that it always adheres to, and because of its importance it is stated in bold font below:</p>

		<p>The system answers “yes” to exactly one question and “no” to the three others.</p>

		<p>All the experiments we have done in our laboratories indicate that this rule is always obeyed in an ideal world in which the detectors used to record the system’s responses work perfectly. We will assume henceforth that the detectors are perfect.**</p>

		<p>An important feature of Peres-1 is that it is possible to ask any question as a part of four different compatible sets. For example, question 1 can be asked as a part of (1,2,3,4), (1,2,15,16), (1,3,17,18) or (1,4,23,24). It seems obvious that the system would give the same answer to 1 no matter which set it is asked as a part of. Suppose, for example, that 1 is “Have you visited Boston?”, 2 is “Have you visited London?” and 3 is “Have you visited Tokyo?”. Then why would you answer 1 differently if it is asked with 2 instead of 3?  The assumption that a system gives the same answer to a question no matter what other questions it is asked with is termed “noncontextuality”, whereas if this is not the case the system is said to be “contextual”.</p>

		<p>How does a quantum system respond to a set of yes-no questions asked of it? The rule stated in bold font above, which is derived from experiment, is one constraint the particular system we are looking at always obeys. But are there any other features that govern its responses? The following two would seem quite reasonable: firstly, that the answer to any question is determined completely by the internal structure of the system and merely gets revealed when the question is asked and, secondly, that the answer is noncontextual. It is difficult to give an ironclad justification of either assumption, but it might be surmised that most physicists of the mid twentieth century (including our three protagonists) thought them quite reasonable. The example of visiting different cities in the previous paragraph tries to illustrate, in particular, why the assumption of noncontextuality might seem like a natural one.</p>

		<p>However, Bell, Kochen and Specker showed that these two seemingly reasonable assumptions are inconsistent with the requirement stated in bold font above. It is not hard to see why by using the setting afforded to us by Peres-1. For, in the context of this game, what we must demonstrate that it is impossible to assign a yes (Y) or no (N) answer to each of the 24 questions in such a way that every circle on the gameboard has exactly one Y and three N’s in it.</p>

		<p>But each of the winning positions in Peres-1 shows that this cannot be done, and so we are done almost as soon as we started!</p>

		<p>To understand better why we have succeeded, note that any winning position has an odd number of circles in it and therefore an odd number of Y’s (since every circle is required to have exactly one Y in it). But, on the other hand, each question in a winning position gets repeated over an even number of its circles and this forces the total number of Y’s over all the circles to be even. However, the total number of Y’s over all the circles of a winning position cannot be both even and odd at the same time, and this demonstrates the impossibility of the task we set ourselves. (It goes without saying that if we cannot succeed with a subset of the 24 circles, we cannot succeed with the entire set either).</p>

		<p>It was the singular achievement of Peres that he was able to come up with a system as simple as Peres-1 to clinch this argument. The constructions used earlier by Bell and by Kochen and Specker were both more complicated in comparison.</p>

		<p>The general conclusion arrived at by Bell, Kochen and Specker is often referred to as the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem. One way of stating it is to say that noncontextual answers do not generally exist to complete sets of yes-no questions that can be asked of quantum systems, if one further insists that every set has exactly one yes answer in it. A “complete” set in Peres-1 consists of four questions, whereas in Peres-2 it is eight questions. It is possible to find games involving complete sets of d questions, for any value of d from 3 up, for which a similar failure is guaranteed.</p>

		<p>But that is not quite the end of the story. After Bell made his own argument arriving at the above conclusion (in the 1960s), he saw a way of eliminating the contradiction it led to: it consists merely of dropping the assumption of noncontextuality. If this assumption is dropped, all the system has to do to comply with the other requirements on it is to answer yes to just one question in each set without caring if its answer to any question changes from one set to another. This might seem like capricious or devious behavior to us, but then why should we expect microscopic entities like atoms and molecules, of which we have no direct experience, to behave in accordance with our expectations? The main message of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem is that we cannot insist on the existence of both preexisting and noncontextual answers to all sets of yes/no questions in the face of all the experimental evidence we have. This is a highly important and significant conclusion about nature, but perhaps not what most physicists would call earth shattering.</p>

		<p>However, what Bell then went on to do was. He came up with an ingenious experiment that allowed him to demonstrate a far more striking contradiction between our expectations of how nature behaves and the way it actually does. This insight is contained in his famous “Bell’s theorem” (which is not to be confused with the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem discussed above). Bell’s strategy can be applied to Peres-1 to convert it from being merely a proof of the BKS theorem into a proof of his more powerful result as well. However, we will not do this here as a simpler argument of the same kind is given later in connection with the Peres-Mermin Square and the GHZ-Mermin Pentagram, both also featured on this site.</p>

		<p>And that brings this brief account to a close.</p>

		<p>**In a laboratory realization of this game, the detectors used to interrogate the system are not perfect and sometimes refuse to fire. In the language of the text, this means that the system sometimes fails to return an answer to the questions put to it. This failure makes it impossible to realize the game faithfully in the laboratory and calls into question the conclusions we have drawn from it. Because of this, Peres-1 is best regarded as a “thought experiment” (i.e., one that can be carried out in principle, if not in practice) that allows us to draw an important conclusion about nature. Performing a realistic experiment that allows us to draw the same conclusions, despite all the limitations of our laboratory equipment, is a difficult task. The experiments performed to test Bell’s theorem also had to deal with the problem of imperfect detectors, and other complications besides. It took three Nobel laureates, and their research teams, many years of hard work to do it!</p>
