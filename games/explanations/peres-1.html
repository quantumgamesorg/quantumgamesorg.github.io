		<h2>Why winning Peres-1 proves Einstein wrong</h2>

		<p>The numbers 1 to 24 in the game each represent a yes-no question that can be asked of a quantum system. Each question amounts to asking the system if it possesses a certain property or not, and the system replies with either a “yes” or a “no”.  The four questions in any circle represent a compatible set of questions, i.e., ones that can all be asked of the system using the same experimental arrangement. By contrast, any four questions that do not occur together in one of the circles constitute an incompatible set in that there is no experimental arrangement that allows them all to be asked of the system at the same time.</p>

		<p>How does the system respond to a compatible set of questions? There is one inflexible rule that it always adheres to, and because of its importance it is stated in bold font below:</p>

		<p><b>The system answers “yes” to exactly one question and “no” to the three others.</b></p>

		<p>All the experiments we have done in our laboratories indicate that this rule is always obeyed in an ideal world in which the detectors used to record the system’s responses work perfectly. We will assume henceforth that the detectors are perfect.**</p>

		<p>An important feature of Peres-1 is that it is possible to ask any question as a part of four different compatible sets. For example, question 1 can be asked as a part of (1,2,3,4), (1,2,15,16), (1,3,17,18) or (1,4,23,24). It seems obvious that the system would give the same answer to 1 no matter which of these four sets it is asked as a part of. If, for example, 1 is “Have you visited Boston?”, 2 is “Have you visited London?” and 3 is “Have you visited Tokyo?”, then why would a person answer 1 differently if it is asked with 2 or, alternatively, with 3?  The assumption that a system gives the same answer to a question no matter what other questions are asked with it is termed “noncontextuality”. On the other hand, if the system answers a question differently for the different sets it is asked as a part of, it is said to be “contextual”.</p>

		<p>Einstein made two assumptions about the way a quantum system responds to a yes-no question asking if it possesses a certain property or not: he assumed, firstly, that the system knows the answer and merely reveals it when asked and, secondly, that it always responds noncontextually. Both these assumptions seem quite natural and in accord with our everyday experiences (as the example of visiting cities in the previous paragraph tried to illustrate).</p>

		<p>It is against this background that one can understand the trap that Bell, Kochen and Specker and, after them, Peres sprang for Einstein. The challenge for Einstein, in the context of Peres-1, is to answer each of the 24 questions with a yes (Y) or a no (N) in such a way that each circle in the gameboard has exactly one Y and three N’s in it, <b>for only then would the preexisting and noncontextual answers be in accord with the rule stated in bold font above</b> (which Einstein would certainly accept, since it is sanctioned by experiment).</p>

		<p>However, the winning positions in Peres-1 show that Einstein must fail. For, on the one hand, a winning position has an odd number of circles and therefore an odd number of Y’s in it (since every circle is required to have exactly one Y); but, on the other hand, each of the questions in a winning position gets repeated over an even number of its circles and causes the total number of Y’s over all the circles to be even.</p>

		<p>But the total number of Y’s over all the circles of a winning position cannot be both even and odd at the same time!</p>

		<p>This contradiction shows that preexisting and noncontextual answers to all the yes-no questions in Peres-1 that also satisfy the requirement shown in bold font above do not exist.</p>

		<p>It should be added that it is possible to find sets of yes-no questions for which preexisting and noncontextual answers do exist, and which also satisfy the requirement that there is always exactly one yes answer to the questions in a compatible set. But the whole point is that there are sets like Peres-1 for which these criteria cannot be met, and which therefore rule out the  joint existence of preexisting and noncontextual values of the properties of quantum systems. The singular achievement of Peres was that he was able to come up with a system as simple as Peres-1 to clinch this argument; in comparison, the arguments given earlier by Bell and by Kochen and Specker were both more complicated.</p>

		<p>But that is not quite the end of the story. After Bell made his own argument arriving at the above conclusion (in the 1960s), he saw a way of eliminating the contradiction it led to: it consists simply of dropping the assumption of noncontextuality. If this assumption is dropped, then all the system has to do is to flip its answers to the questions in some of the compatible sets to ensure that each such set always has exactly one Y in it. This might seem capricious and offend our sensibilities about the way nature ought to behave, but then why should microscopic objects like atoms and molecules behave in accordance with our expectations? The main message of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem, as the above conclusion is often referred to, is that we cannot insist on the existence of both preexisting and noncontextual answers to the questions we pose a quantum system about its properties; there are sets of questions, like those in Peres-1, for which these expectations are definitely not met. While this is an important conclusion, it may not exactly be considered earth shattering.</p>

		<p>However, what Bell then went on to do was. He came up with an ingenious experiment that allowed him to demonstrate a far more striking contradiction between our expectations of how nature behaves and the way it actually does. This insight is contained in his famous “Bell’s theorem” (which is not to be confused with the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem mentioned above). Bell’s strategy can be applied to Peres-1 to convert it into a thought experiment that demonstrates his more powerful result. However, we will not do this here as a simpler argument of the same kind is given later in connection with the Peres-Mermin Square and the GHZ-Mermin Pentagram, which are both also featured on this site.</p>

		<p>And that brings this brief account to a close.</p>

		<p>**In a laboratory realization of this game, the detectors used to interrogate the system are not perfect and sometimes refuse to fire. In the language of the text, this means that the system sometimes fails to return an answer to the questions put to it. This failure makes it impossible to realize the game faithfully in the laboratory and calls into question the conclusions we have drawn from it. Because of this, Peres-1 is best regarded as a “thought experiment” (i.e., one that can be carried out in principle, if not in practice) that allows us to draw an important conclusion about nature. Performing a realistic experiment that allows us to draw the same conclusions, despite all the limitations of our laboratory equipment, is a difficult task. The experiments performed to test Bell’s theorem also had to deal with the problem of imperfect detectors, and other complications besides. It took three Nobel laureates, and their research teams, many years of hard work to do it!</p>
