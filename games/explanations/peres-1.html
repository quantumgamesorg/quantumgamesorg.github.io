		<h2>Why winning Peres-1 proves Einstein wrong</h2>

		<p> The numbers 1 to 24 in the game each represent a yes-no question that can be asked of a quantum system (of which an atom or a molecule might be an example). Each question amounts to asking the system if it possesses a certain property or not, and the system replies with a “yes” or a “no”.  The four questions in any circle represent a compatible set of questions, i.e., ones that can all be asked of the system using the same experimental arrangement. By contrast, any four questions that do not occur together in one of the circles are an incompatible set, in the sense that they cannot all be posed to the system at the same time.</p>    
		
	        <p> How does the system respond to a compatible set of questions? There is one rule it always obeys, and because of its importance it is stated in bold font below:</p>

		<p><b>The system answers “yes” to exactly one question and “no” to the three others.</b></p>

		<p>All the experiments we have done in our laboratories indicate that this rule is always obeyed in an ideal world in which the detectors used to observe the system’s responses work perfectly. We will assume henceforth that this is the case.** </p>

		<p>An important feature of Peres-1 is that it is possible to ask any question as a part of four different compatible sets. For example, question 1 can be asked as a part of (1,2,3,4), (1,2,15,16), (1,3,17,18) or (1,4,23,24). It seems obvious that the system would give the same answer to 1 no matter which set it is asked as a part of. Suppose, for example, that 1 is “Have you visited Boston?”, 2 is “Have you visited London?” and 3 is “Have you visited Tokyo?”. Then why would you answer 1 differently if it is asked with 2 instead of 3?  The assumption that a quantum system gives the same answer to a question no matter what other questions it is asked with is termed “noncontextuality”, whereas if this is not the case the system is said to be “contextual”.</p>

		<p>Bell, Kochen and Specker made the surprising discovery that the assumption that the system answers questions noncontextually is in conflict with the rule stated in bold font above. </p>

		<p>This can be seen very easily by using the setting afforded by Peres-1, for what we must demonstrate is that it is impossible to assign a yes (Y) or no (N) to each of the 24 questions in such a way that every circle has exactly one Y and three N’s in it. But each of the winning positions in Peres-1 shows that this is impossible, and so we are done! </p>

		<p>To understand why the task we set ourselves is impossible, note that any winning position has an odd number of circles in it and therefore an odd number of Y’s in it (since every circle is required to have exactly one Y in it, by the rule in bold font). However each question in a winning position occurs in an even number of its circles, and this reqires the total number of Y’s over all the circles to be even. But the total number of Y’s over all the circles of a winning position cannot be both even and odd at the same time, and this demonstrates the impossibility of the task we set ourselves! (It goes without saying that if we cannot succeed at our task with a subset of the 24 circles, we cannot succeed with the entire set either).  </p>

		<p>It was the singular achievement of Peres that he was able to come up with a system as simple as Peres-1 with which to clinch this argument. The constructions used earlier by Bell and by Kochen and Specker were both more complicated in comparison.</p>

		<p>The conclusion arrived at by Bell, Kochen and Specker is often referred to as the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem. One way of stating it, in keeping with the demonstration just given, is that noncontextual answers do not generally exist to “complete” sets of yes-no questions that can be asked of a quantum system if we also insist that every set has exactly one yes answer in it. By a “complete” set we mean the maximum number of questions that can be posed of the system using a given experimental arrangement. In Peres-1 a complete set consists of four questions, whereas in Peres-2 it consists of eight questions. </p>

		<p>However, that is not quite the end of the story. After Bell made his own argument arriving at the above conclusion (in the 1960s) he saw a way of eliminating the contradiction to which it led: it consists simply of dropping the assumption of noncontextuality. If this assumption is dropped, the system can satisfy the rule stated in bold font simply by answering yes to an arbitrary question in each set without caring if its answer to a given question is the same in all the sets or not. This might seem like capricious behavior on the system’s part, but then why should we expect microscopic objects like atoms and molecules, of which we have no direct experience, to behave in accordance with our expectations? </p>

		<p>In short, the message of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem is that we cannot insist on the existence of both preexisting and noncontextual answers to all sets of yes/no questions that can be asked of a quantum system if each set is to have exactly one "yes" answer in it (and this turns out to be true even if some of the sets fall short of being complete!). This is a highly important and significant conclusion about nature, but might fall a bit short short of what most physicists would consider earth shattering. </p>

	        <p>However, what Bell next went on to do was. He came up with an ingenious experiment that allowed him to demonstrate a far more striking contradiction between our expectations of how nature behaves and the way it actually does. This insight is contained in his famous “Bell’s theorem” (not to be confused with the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem discussed above). Bell’s strategy can be applied to Peres-1 to convert it from being merely a proof of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem into a proof of his more powerful theorem as well. However, we will not do this as a simpler argument of the same kind is given in connection with the Peres-Mermin Square and the GHZ-Mermin Pentagram, both also featured on this site.</p>  

		<p>And that brings this brief account to a close ... (but see the end of Notes for some further reading, if interested).  </p>

		<p>**In a laboratory realization of this game, the detectors used to record the system’s answers are not perfect and sometimes refuse to fire. In other words, one sometimes fails to get answers to the questions one puts to the system. This failure makes it impossible to realize the game, as we have described it, in the laboratory and calls into question the conclusions we have drawn from it. Because of this shortcoming , Peres-1 is best thought of as a “thought experiment” (pun unintended!) that allows us to draw an important conclusion about nature. Performing a realistic experiment that allows us to draw the same conclusion, despite all the limitations of our laboratory equipment, is a difficult task. The experiments performed to test Bell’s theorem also had to deal with the problem of imperfect detectors, and other complications besides. It took three Nobel laureates and their research teams many years of hard work to do it!  </p>
