		<h2>Explanation</h2>

		<p>It seems reasonable to assume that the detectors are triggered by the signals they get from the source. If they are triggered by some other agency, then that agency must play the role of the source in the account below.</p>

		<p>There is no telling what the common panel(s) on the two detectors will be in any run, since Alice and Bob make their choice of detector settings independently and randomly just before the signals arrive. The common panel could therefore be any one of the ten or, if Alice and Bob choose the same line of panels, all the ones on that line.</p>

		<p>But if the common panel(s) is/are always to light up the same color(s) on both detectors, the detectors must be instructed to light up all their panels in the same way as each other in every run, since only then will the common panel(s) always have the same color(s). This can be achieved by having the signals from the source convey identical “instruction sets” to the detectors telling them how to light up their panels in any run. An example of such an instruction set is shown below.</p>

		<p>The instruction sets sent to both detectors in any run must always be the same, but they can vary from run to run. Alice’s detector would use the appropriate line of the instruction set to light itself up in any run, as would Bob’s.</p>

		<p>Since each line on a detector always lights up with an odd number of red panels, the total number of red panels over all five lines of an instruction set must be odd.</p>

		<p>But because each panel occurs at the intersection of two lines, each red panel gets counted twice in the sum over the lines and causes the total number of red panels over all five lines to be even.</p>

		<p>However, the sum of the red panels over all the lines cannot be both even and odd at the same time, and this shows the impossibility of devising instruction sets that will make the detectors light up in the way they do.</p>

		<p>The only explanation for this demonstration would seem to be that when one of the detectors fires, it instantly communicates its pattern of lights to the other, which then adjusts its response to satisfy all the conditions required of it.</p>

		<p>But this instant (or, at least, superluminal) communication is nothing other than the “spooky action at a distance” that Einstein found so hard to accept!</p>

		<p>One can circumvent this paradox by denying the existence of free will, or introducing other drastic assumptions, but a further discussion of the matter will not be pursued here.</p>

	        <p>The way this game can be realized in the laboratory will not be discussed here, as the details are complicated.</p>
