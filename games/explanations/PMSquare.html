		<h2>Explanation</h2>

		<p>It seems reasonable to assume that the detectors are triggered by the signals they get from the source. If they are triggered by some other agency, then that agency must play the role of the source in the account below.</p>

		<p>There is no telling what the common panel on the two detectors will be in any run, since Alice and Bob make their choice of detector settings independently and randomly just before the signals arrive. The common panel could therefore be any one of the nine.</p>

		<p>But if the common panel is always to light up the same color on both detectors, the detectors must be instructed to light up all their panels in the same way as each other in every run, since only then will the common panel always have the same color. This can be achieved by having the signals from the source convey identical “instruction sets” to the detectors telling them how to light up their panels in any run. An example of an instruction set is shown below.</p>

		<table>
			<tr><td class="red"></td><td class="red"></td><td class="grn"></td></tr>
			<tr><td class="grn"></td><td class="red"></td><td class="red"></td></tr>
			<tr><td class="grn"></td><td class="grn"></td><td class="grn"></td></tr>
		</table>

		<p>The instruction sets sent to both detectors in any run must always be the same, but the set itself can vary from run to run. Alice’s detector would use the appropriate row of the instruction set, and Bob’s the appropriate column, to light themselves up in any run.</p>

		<p>Since each row of Alice’s detector always lights up with an even number of red panels, the total number of red panels in the instruction set given to her must be even.</p>

		<p>But since each column of Bob’s detector always lights up with an odd number of red panels, the total number of red panels in the instruction set given to him must be odd.</p>

		<p>However, if Alice and Bob are to receive identical instruction sets, the total number of red panels in it cannot be both even and odd at the same time! This contradiction shows that there are no instruction sets that can make the detectors light up in the way they do.</p>

		<p>The only explanation for the demonstration would seem to be that when one of the detectors fires, it instantly communicates its pattern of lights to the other, which then adjusts its response to satisfy all the conditions required of it.</p>

		<p>But this instant (or, at least, superluminal) communication is nothing other than the “spooky action at a distance” that Einstein found so hard to accept!</p>

		<p>One can circumvent this paradox by denying the existence of free will, or introducing other drastic assumptions, but a further discussion of the matter will not be pursued here.</p>

		<p>The way this game can be realized in the laboratory will not be discussed here. But see Notes for a reference where such a discussion can be found.</p>
