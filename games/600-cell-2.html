                            <p>Qudoku, which is a contraction of Quantum Sudoku, is a number puzzle that has its origins in quantum mechanics. Okay, it's not like the Sudoku you know, but it does involve numbers and it is a puzzle. So what is it?</p>
                            <p>Before we tell you that, let's turn the clock back a bit...</p>
                            <p>In 1935 Einstein and his colleagues Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen wrote a paper in which they expressed their dissatisfaction with quantum mechanics. It's not that they thought it was wrong, it's just that they felt it was an incomplete theory because it denied the existence of an objective reality and also talked in terms of probabilities rather than making definite predictions about the properties of physical systems. They believed it would eventually be replaced by a better theory that conformed more to their notions of what nature was really like. Einstein's unhappiness with the quantum theory eventually passed into the folklore in the form of the saying "God doesn't play dice".</p>
                            <p>In the mid-1960s the physicist J.S.Bell and, independently, the mathematicians S.Kochen and E.P.Specker demonstrated, in different ways, that the hopes of Einstein and his colleagues could never be met. They did this by showing that theories of the sort favored by Einstein and his colleagues made the wrong predictions for certain types of experiments with which quantum mechanics always agreed. In the more than fifty years since then, the arguments of Bell, Kochen and Specker have been refined and extended in many ways and also subjected to a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated experimental tests. The general consensus among physicists now is that Einstein was wrong and that the weird and counterintuitive features of quantum mechanics he objected to are not artifacts of the theory but reflect actual features of the world we live in.</p>
                            <p>In 1991 the Israeli physicist Asher Peres found a simpler way of arriving at the conclusions of Bell, Kochen and Specker. Peres' argument is presented in the form of a game in this applet. If you play the game and win, you would have succeeded in reconstructing Peres' version of the proof of Bell, Kochen and Specker that Einstein was wrong when he said "God doesn't play dice".</p>

                            <p>The gameboard consists of 24 circles containing the numbers from 1 to 24, with each circle containing four numbers and each number occurring in four different circles.</p>
                            <p>The two outer circles in line with a pair of inner circles contain complementary mixes of the numbers in the inner circles.</p>
                            <p>To play the game you must make a series of moves, each of which consists of placing your cursor over a circle and clicking, causing the circle and its contents to light up in red.</p>
                            <p>You win the game if you can light up an odd number of circles in such a way that each of the numbers that occurs in those circles occurs in an even number of them. A number to the right of the gameboard tells you how many moves you have made, with an odd number being shown in green and an even number in red. You can win only if this number is odd (green).</p>
                            <p>The scoreboard at the bottom shows you how many times each of the numbers in the circles you have picked appears in them. Numbers that occur an odd number of times (1 or 3) are shown in red while those that occur an even number of times (2 or 4) are shown in green. You win the game only if the numbers lit up on the scoreboard are all green.</p>
                            <p>When you win the game the header at the top changes from "Does God play dice?" in red to "God does play dice!" in green.</p>
                            <p>If you make 15 moves without winning, you have lost and must start over again.</p>
                            <p>You can undo any previous moves simply by clicking on the lighted circles. You can also reset the game to START at any time if you wish.</p>
                            <p>There are many different ways of winning the game and a simple strategy that will always allow you to win. Can you figure it out?</p>

            <h2>Triacontagonal proofs of Bell's theorem</h2>

            <p>The geometer H.S.M.Coxeter found a way of projecting the 600-cell from four dimensions into two in such a way that its 120 vertices appear as the vertices of four concentric regular triacontagons (or 30-sided polygons) and its 720 edges as the 120 edges of the triacontagons and 600 line segments joining pairs of vertices of different triacontagons. This projection has a 30-fold axis of rotation about its center, which gives it a highly symmetrical appearance. Coxeter called it the triacontagonal projection and showed it as the frontispiece of his monograph Regular Polytopes. </p>
            <p>One can imagine a four-dimensional creature holding a model of the 600-cell in its hands in such a way that the sun shining directly overhead casts a shadow of it on a plane that is the triacontagonal projection. Moreover, the creature can rotate the model into 120 different positions that all yield triacontagonal projections on the given plane. </p>
            <p>The triacontagonal projection holds the key to a highly symmetrical class of quantum contextual sets contained in the 600-cell. The sets are 30-15 sets and there are 120 pairs of them, with the members of each pair having no vertex-pair in common and exhausting all 60 vertex-pairs of the 600-cell between them.</p>
            <p>The triacontagonal projections can be used to extract these sets very easily: for any projection, the vertex-pairs in the innermost and outermost triacontagons yield one of the sets and those in the two intermediate triacontagons its complement. </p>
            <p>The “helper” table makes it easy to pick out the right pairs of triacontagons in any decomposition that yield a complementary pair of 30-15 sets. </p>
            <p>The helper table consists of a 6 x 6 array of blocks, with each block containing 10 numbers and all the numbers occurring exactly once in every row or column of blocks. If one picks any row or column of blocks, and then any three blocks in that row or column, the numbers in those blocks yield a 30-15 set and the numbers in the remaining blocks of that row or column the complementary 30-15 set. The 120 different ways of partitioning the rows and columns of helper table each correspond to a way of pairing triacontagons within the 600-cell that lead to a complementary pair of 30-15 sets. </p>
            <p>Once you have picked out three blocks from any row or column of the helper table, the corresponding 30-15 set is shown in red in the basis table and the complementary 30-15 set in green. </p>
