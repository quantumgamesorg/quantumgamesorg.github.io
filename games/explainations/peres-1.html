            <h2>Why winning Peres-1 proves Einstein wrong</h2>

            <p>The numbers 1 to 24 in the game each represent a yes-no question that can be asked of a quantum system. Each question amounts to asking the system if it possesses a certain property or not, and the system replies with either a “yes” or a “no” (and never a “maybe” or “I don’t know”)**. The four questions in any circle represent a compatible set of questions, i.e., ones that can all be asked of the system using the same experimental arrangement. By contrast, any four questions that do not occur together in one of the circles constitute an incompatible set in that there is no experimental arrangement that allows them all to be posed to the system at the same time.</p>

			<p>How does the system respond to a compatible set of questions? There is one inflexible rule that it always adheres to, and because of its importance in the discussion to follow, it is stated in bold font below:</p>
			
			<p><b>The system answers “yes” to exactly one question and “no” to the three others.</b></p>
			
			<p>All the experiments we have done in our laboratories indicates that this rule is always obeyed in an ideal world in which the detectors used to record the system’s answers to the questions work perfectly.</p>
			
			<p>An important feature of Peres-1 is that it is possible to ask any question as a part of four different compatible sets. For example, question 1 can be asked as a part of (1,2,3,4), (1,2,15,16), (1,3,17,18) or (1,4,23,24). It seems obvious that the system would give the same answer to 1 no matter which of these four sets it is asked as a part of. For, if 1 is the question “Have you visited Boston?”, 2 is “Have you visited London?” and 3 is “Have you visited Tokyo?”, then why would a person answer 1 differently if it is asked with 2 as opposed to 3?  The assumption that a system gives the same answer to a question no matter which set it is asked as a part of is termed “noncontextuality”. On the other hand, if the system answers a question differently in the different sets it is a part of, it is said to be “contextual”.</p>
			
			<p>Einstein made two assumptions about the way a system responds to a yes-no question. The first was that the answer is determined by the inner details of the system and the system merely reveals the answer when asked. And the second was that the system always responds noncontextually to any yes-no question put to it. In other words, Einstein assumed that the answers to all yes-no questions asked of a quantum system were both preexisting and noncontextual. All our experiences in our everyday world seem to attest to this (as the example of visiting cities in the previous paragraph illustrates).</p>

			<p>It is against this background that one can understand the trap that Bell, Kochen and Specker and, after them, Peres sprang for Einstein. The challenge for Einstein, in the context of Peres-1, is to answer each of the 24 questions with a yes (Y) or a no (N) in such a way that each circle in the gameboard has exactly one Y and three N’s in it, for only then would the preexisting and noncontextual answers to the questions be in accord with the rule stated in bold font above (which Einstein would certainly accept, because it is sanctioned by experiment).</p>

			<p>However the winning positions in Peres-1 show that Einstein must fail. For, on the one hand, a winning position has an odd number of circles and therefore an odd number of Y’s in it (since every circle is required to have exactly one Y in it); but, on the other hand, since each of the questions in the circles of a winning position occurs an even number of times over those circles, every Y answer gets repeated an even number of times (if the answers are to noncontextual) and this causes the total number of Y’s over all the circles even.</p>

			<p>This contradiction shows that the joint assumptions of preexisting and noncontextual answers to yes-no questions do not generally hold for quantum systems. This is the content of the so called Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem. The demonstration of this theorem using Peres-1 is considerably simpler than the demonstrations given by its original authors.</p>

			<p>However, Bell saw a weakness in his argument as soon as he came up with it: he realized that if one abandoned the requirement of noncontextuality, the contradiction with experiment would disappear. All the system would have to do was to flip its answers to some of the questions in some of the sets to ensure that each set always had exactly one Y in it. This might offend our sensibilities (or Einstein’s) about the way nature ought to behave, but then why should microscopic entities like atoms and molecules behave in accordance with our expectations? To sum up, the only conclusion we can draw from the above thought experiment is that answers to yes-no questions that are both preexisting and noncontextual are not possible, and that one or other of these requirements must be dropped.</p>

			<p>This might not seem like a very striking conclusion, but Bell didn’t stop there. He came up with an ingenious modification to the above experiment that allowed him to expose a far more striking contradiction between our expectations of how nature behaves at the microscopic level and the way it actually does. This insight is contained in his now famous result known as “Bell’s theorem” (which is not to be confused with the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem mentioned above). Bell’s strategy can be applied to Peres-1 to convert it from being a mere rejection of the joint notions of noncontextuality and preexisting values into a full-fledged proof of his more powerful theorem. However, this will not be done here as simpler arguments of the same kind are given in connection with the Peres-Mermin Square and the GHZ-Mermin Pentagram, which are both featured on this site.</p>

			<p>What Bell’s theorem does is to demonstrate that the “spooky action at a distance” which Einstein objected to is not merely an artifact of the quantum formalism but a phenomenon that can be observed in the laboratory. The Peres-Mermin Square and the GHZ-Mermin Pentagram, both featured on this site, are examples of experiments that demonstrate this phenomenon.</p>

			<p>And that brings this brief account to a close.</p>

			<p>**In a laboratory realization of this game, the interrogation of the quantum system is carried out by means of detectors that are not perfect and which sometimes refuse to fire. In the language of the text, this means that the system sometimes fails to give an answer to the questions we put to it. This failure makes the experiment described in the text impossible to realize in the laboratory and the conclusion drawn from it suspect. More properly, the experiment described above is an example of a “thought experiment” (i.e., one that can be carried out in principle, even if it is hard to realize in practice) that allows one to draw an important conclusion about nature. Performing a realistic experiment to establish Bell’s theorem, despite all the limitations of our laboratory apparatus, is a difficult task that took three Nobel laureates and their research teams many years of hard work to accomplish.</p>
