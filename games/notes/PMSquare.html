		<h2>Notes</h2>
		<p>This demonstration is based on the ideas of A. Peres, J. Phys. <b>A24</b>, 174-178 (1991) and N.D. Mermin, Rev. Mod. Phys. 65, 803-815 (1993). The latter article mentions a number of references that also influenced this work.</p>

		<p>The work of Peres and Mermin was further developed by A.Cabello, Phys.Rev.Lett. <b>87</b>, 010403 (2001) and P.K.Aravind, Found. Phys. Lett. 15, 397 (2002).</p>

		<p>The demonstration, as given here, closely parallels the account in P.K. Aravind, Am. J. Phys. <b>72</b>, 1303-1307 (2004).</p>

		<p>The Mermin-Peres Magic Square, as it is sometimes called, has been used to propose a type of quantum game known as Pseudo-Telepathy by Prof. Gilles Brassard and his collaborators at the Universite de Montreal. A number of physicists and computer scientists have contributed to the further development of this new offshoot of traditional game theory. For a brief survey, see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_pseudo-telepathy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_pseudo-telepathy</a></p>

		<p>A laboratory realization of this demonstration has been achieved by Jia-Min Xu et.al., Phys. Rev. Lett. <b>129</b>, 050402 (2022). A non-technical account of their experiment, including a discussion of its limitations and its broader significance, can be found at: <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/researchers-use-quantum-telepathy-to-win-an-impossible-game">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/researchers-use-quantum-telepathy-to-win-an-impossible-game</a></p>
