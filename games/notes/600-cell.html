		<p>The table for the 600-cell and the patterns in it have been taken from M.Waegell, P.K. Aravind, N.D.Megill and M.Pavicic, “Parity Proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker Theorem Based on the 600-cell.” <i>Found Phys</i> <b>41</b>, 883–904 (2011).</p>
		
		<p>P.Lisonek, R.Raussendorf, and V.Singh, arXiv:1401.3035 showed that the 600-cell has 2<sup>33</sup> “parity proofs” in it (this is the technical term for the patterns shown here). However, many of the patterns have smaller patterns embedded in them and so are not "irreducible". The exact number of irreducible patterns is not known, but runs into the millions, at the very least.</p>
