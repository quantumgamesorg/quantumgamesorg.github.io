		<h2>Notes</h2>
		<p>The table for the two-qubit system and the quantum contextual sets in it are taken from M.Waegell and P.K.Aravind, J Phys A: Math. Theor. <b>44</b>, 505303 (2011).</p>
		
		<p> It has been shown by P.Lisonek, R.Raussendorf and V.Singh. arXiv:1401.3035 that the two-qubit system has 2<sup>64</sup> “parity proofs” in it (this is the technical term for the patterns shown here). However, many of these patterns are not elementary in the sense that they have smaller patterns embedded in them. An exact count of the elementary patterns is not known, but their number runs into the billions. </p>
