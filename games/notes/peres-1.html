		<p>The idea of this demonstration was proposed in A.Peres,  J. Phys. <b>A24</b>, L175 (1991).</p>

		<p>The demonstration also makes use of results reported by A.Cabello, J.M. Estebaranz and G.Garcia-Alcaine, Phys. Lett. A <b>212</b>, 183 (1996) and M.Pavicic, N.D.Megill and J.P.Merlet, Phys. Lett. A <b>374</b>, 2122 (2010).</p>

		<p>The gameboard is taken from M.Waegell, and P.K.Aravind, Found. Phys. <b>41</b>: 1786 (2011). </p>
