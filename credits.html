			<h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>This website was put together by a number of undergraduate students at WPI, working under the direction of Professor P.K.Aravind. Most of the students did this work as part of their Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP), one of the degree requirements at WPI. The students who contributed to this project include James McClung, David Mahany, Ivan Martinovic, Tianxing (Daniel) Weng, Paola Frunzio, Mason Sakai, Trey Bowen, Robin Husman and Celeste Ma.</p>
